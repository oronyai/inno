<h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
<p>Team Univeristy (TU) - Nebbi Study Center is one of the avenues provided by <a onclick="alert('you are now leaving this page')" href="https://teamuniversity.ac.ug/">Team University, Kampala</a> to prospective students in the Greater Nebbi. This sub-region is one of the poorest in the country yet the people are expected to travel to other areas to attain higher education, thus the immeasurable need for distant learning opportunities.<br>

TU - Nebbi Study Center therefore, brings quality higher education closer and affordably to the people, with a variety of <a href="file:///C:/Users/HUAWEI/OneDrive/Documents/New%20folder/Course%20List.html"><b>courses</b></a> in the disciplines of:
<ul style="list-style-type:square; font-family:arial narrow; color:blue">
	<li><b>Business and Management</li>
	<li>Social Works and Governance</li>
	<li>Applied Sciences</li>
	<li>Education</b></li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Background</u></h2>
<p>Nebbi Study Center started in 2017 with just a few courses and a minimal number of students basically because of the lack of information about it. The student population has steadily increased over the years as more poeple come to know of us. Due to the high demand for our services, we've been compelled to introduce more courses and expand on our academic staff to respond to the resultant challenges.</p>

<p>We're also on track with infrastructural development at the campus. Currently, we share premises with Good Parents Nursery and Primary School but there are already more buidings under construction to provide for more lecture rooms, laboratories, library as well as administration block.</p>

<h2><u>The future prospect</u></h2>
<p>Confidence in our center is at a record high as a number of students who have so far graduated over the years are highly placed and offering exceptional services to the community. This is a testament to the quality of education that we offer. We continue to better our services by the day, with the growing number of both the students and staff.</p>

<p>This growing confidence is pushing the demand for more courses. We are gradually venturing into more courses to respond to the needs at hand. This is also coming with more infrastrural demand on the Study Center and we are bracing up to take on the challenge. As more students and workers opt for our Study Center, we see ourselves offering more courses at various levels.</p>
