<h2>A Word from the Coordinator</h2>
<p>Welcome to Team University - Nebbi Study Center, a place of excellence!<br>
Here is the place to come for education in your own convinience. Our idea of higher education is that by the time you reach this level, you're old enough to do something for your survival. We don't want that interrupted: that's why we study on weekends. You can as well pay in installments.<br>
This has made us even more affordable and convinient. Find out more about us: the courses, fees and quality. You're welcome!<br><br>

Mr. Kisa Lawrence Ojok<br>
Coordinator
